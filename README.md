# Bookit
I like to read multiple books at once but having a physical bookmark for each one can be a hassle since they slip out easily. Goodreads provides page tracking but takes a lot of clicks to update your progress. Using a Notes app is fast but doesn't look as nice. This app aims for that middle ground between function and aesthetics. 

The app also adds a barcode scanner via your phone camera to read the ISBN numbers on the back of every book. The number is then used to scrape data from bookfinder.com. Bookfinder was chosen because it consistently had the most accurate cover art for arbitrary ISBN numbers. 



Tech Used:
 - Android Code Scanner Library (to read barcodes)
 - JSoup (webscraper to get cover art for scanned books)
 - Glide (display cover art)
 - SQLite (to locally store in progress/completed books)
 
## Todos
- Clean up the add book page
- Add in sorting feature (including dates)
- Add in summary page for completed books
- Make assortment of default covers for no image or add in search image functionality 

## Screenshots
Coming soon
