# Bookit
I like to read multiple books at once but having a physical bookmark for each one can be a hassle since they slip out easily. Goodreads provides page tracking but takes a lot of clicks to update your progress. Using a Notes app is fast but doesn't look as nice. This app aims for that middle ground between function and aesthetics.

The app also adds a barcode scanner via your phone camera to read the ISBN numbers on the back of every book. The number is then used to scrape data from bookfinder.com. Bookfinder was chosen because it consistently had the most accurate cover art for arbitrary ISBN numbers.



Tech Used:
- Android Code Scanner Library (to read barcodes)
- JSoup (webscraper to get cover art for scanned books)
- Glide (display cover art)
- SQLite/SQL (to locally store in progress/completed books)

## Installation
Uploading to Google play store currently in progress. Unfortunately, until then, to demo the app, you will have to download the package and run it through an emulator or physical device by enabling developer tools. A link has been provided to walk you through the steps

Until then, take a look at the screenshots to get a sense of the functionality.

## Features coming soon
