# Bookit
I like to read multiple books at once but having a physical bookmark for each one can be a hassle since they slip out easily. Goodreads provides page tracking but takes a lot of clicks to update your progress. Using a Notes app is fast but doesn't look as nice. This app aims for that middle ground between function and asthetics. 

Tech Used:
 - Android Code Scanner Library (to read barcodes)
 - JSoup (webscraper to get cover art for scanned books)
 - Glide (display cover art)
 - SQLite (to locally store in progress/completed books)
